Resources Needed: 

Pong, Snake, & Tetris: 
- Python 3.8 
- PyCharm 

Snake & Tetris: 
- Pygame 


Issues and Errors: 

Pong: 
- Paddles don't move seemlessly you will have to keep pushing up or down
- Ball randomly speeds up 
- No way determine winner

Snake: 
- I set the snake to move at a faster speed as I was unable to determine in my limited time
  how to effectively slowly increase the speed. Ergo, tight turning is often required
- Graphical issues with displaying an updated score, so no score is displayed while playing the game
- When asked to play again, there is not a decline option 

Tetris: 
- Was unable to make pressing down speed up the fall, it would only move a block down
- Score system was mechanically unable to constantly update, with limited time I left it alone and 
  focused on getting the core of the game finished
